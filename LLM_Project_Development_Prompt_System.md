## Overview

This system provides structured prompts and workflows for collaborating with LLMs on development projects. It ensures comprehensive specification, proper planning, and systematic execution while maintaining quality and security standards.

### Core Principles

* **Explicit Requirements Capture**: Every detail specified upfront
* **Confirmation Before Action**: No assumptions, explicit validation
* **Phased Delivery**: Break complex projects into manageable chunks
* **Quality Gates**: Validation at each phase transition
* **Git-First Approach**: Version control integrated from the start

***

## Prompt Phases

### Phase 1: SPECIFICATION

**Objective**: Capture complete project requirements with no ambiguity

### Phase 2: CONFIRMATION

**Objective**: Validate understanding and get explicit approval

### Phase 3: PLANNING

**Objective**: Break down into phases with clear deliverable

### Phase 4: CHUNKING

**Objective**: Define granular tasks within each phase

### Phase 5: EXECUTION

**Objective**: Implement with continuous validation

### Phase 6: VALIDATION

**Objective**: Test, review, and approve each deliverable

- What integrations with external systems are required?

### 2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Target platform/environment (web, mobile, desktop, server)?
- Technology stack preferences or constraints?
- Performance requirements (users, transactions, response times)?
- Security requirements and compliance needs?
- Database requirements and data models?

### 3. PROJECT CONSTRAINTS
- Timeline and deadline requirements?
- Budget or resource constraints?
- Team size and skill levels?
- Deployment environment and infrastructure?

### 4. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

# Create PR to develop branch
```

### Phase Completion Workflow

```bash
# Phase completion checklist
# 1. All phase tasks completed and merged to develop
# 2. Integration tests passing on develop
# 3. Phase documentation updated
# 4. Phase review completed

# Merge to staging for testing
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

## Best Practices Summary

### üéØ KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Never Skip Specification**: Always capture complete requirements before planning
2. **Explicit Confirmation**: Get written approval at each phase gate
3. **Small Task Chunks**: Keep tasks to 1-4 hours for manageable implementation
4. **Continuous Validation**: Test and validate continuously, not just at the end
5. **Git Discipline**: Use branching strategy consistently for all changes
6. **Documentation First**: Update documentation as you implement, not after
7. **Quality Gates**: Never compromise on quality criteria
8. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout

### üö® COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

- Starting implementation before complete specification
- Assuming understanding without explicit confirmation
- Making phases too large (>2 weeks)
- Skipping testing until the end
- Poor Git hygiene and branching
- Outdated or missing documentation
- Bypassing quality gates due to time pressure
- Lack of stakeholder communication

### üìã PROMPT CHECKLIST

Before using any prompt in this system:
- [ ] Context is clearly established
- [ ] Requirements for response are explicit
- [ ] Confirmation mechanism is defined
- [ ] Next steps are clearly outlined
- [ ] Quality criteria are specified
- [ ] Success/failure conditions are clear

---

*This prompt system ensures systematic, high-quality development projects with clear deliverables, proper validation, and comprehensive documentation throughout the entire development lifecycle.*
